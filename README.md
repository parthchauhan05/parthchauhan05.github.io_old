# Web Portfolio
This project is about showcasing the work I have done till date.

## Layout
```CSS``` Layouts ```Flex``` and ```grid``` are used in this website. ```grid``` is used for ```portfolio``` section however every other sections are using ```flex``` layout.

## Challenges

1.  One major challenge I have faced is fixing primary navigation on the top. I used ```JS``` variables: ```window.pageYOffset``` to fix the main navigation on the scroll.
2.  Animation on the scroll was one more challenge for me. I have tried with ```animate.css``` and ```transition-delay``` but it was never a solution. Then, I dropped ```animate.css``` and used ```aos.css```. After using that, I am able to animate my content on the scroll.
3.  I have used ```.pdf``` files before and I was not sure if the code for downloading images I have used in Interactive Gallery will work. But it worked.
4.  In the ```Home``` section, there is a clip path for a item. I was not sure how to do that. I tried with ```clip-path```. Then, I got confused with that. After that, I have used ```border-radius``` for all four corners.

## Resources
- ```reset.min.css```
- ```font-awesome.min.css```
- ```aos.css```
- ```aos.js```
- ```Open Sans Fonts```

## Future Update
- In future, I will start my personal blog. That will also become part of this portfolio.
- Any future projects and experience will be added.

## What I learned
I learned about how to fix header on scroll. I have a hands on on a library which will help to generate animation on scroll. Also, I got a bit idea of CSS property, ```clip-path```.

I am looking forward to add functionality to my contact form to get an email from there.
